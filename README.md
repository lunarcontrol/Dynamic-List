flasknews
---------

A reddit/hn clone in python/flask.  Very trivial, nothing fancy.  Just mostly playing with flask.

Running it
==========

I dont think this would be good in production yet.  To run, just do ```python news.py --create-db``` to create
the sqlite database, then run ```python news.py``` to serve.  You could also use your favorite wsgi server to
serve it.
